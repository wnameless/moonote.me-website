## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
Potential clients, partners, and job candidates visiting moonote.me need to understand what Moonote Co., Ltd. does, the company's core capabilities, industry expertise, and how they can benefit from Moonote's solutions. The page should clearly communicate the company's value proposition, technical capabilities, and target industries in both Traditional Chinese (primary) and English.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a potential client lands on the About page, **When** they scan the content, **Then** they understand Moonote specializes in enterprise application frameworks and industry-specific solutions for academic, medical, and corporate clients
2. **Given** a visitor wants to understand Moonote's technology, **When** they view the core advantages section, **Then** they see the self-developed framework features (RESTful API, dynamic forms, NoSQL support, permissions, multi-tenancy)
3. **Given** a visitor needs to know industry applications, **When** they view the solutions section, **Then** they see all 8 functional modules fully expanded with complete descriptions visible without requiring clicks or interaction
4. **Given** a prospect wants to see real-world use cases, **When** they view the industry solutions section, **Then** they see all 4 concrete solution examples fully expanded with module combinations and target industries visible
5. **Given** a technical evaluator reviews the page, **When** they read the technical innovation section, **Then** they see specific capabilities like type-safe dynamic queries, object mapping, enterprise SSO, and audit systems
6. **Given** a decision-maker reviews capabilities, **When** they view the development efficiency section, **Then** they see quantified benefits like "70% reduction in repetitive development" and schema-driven UI generation
7. **Given** a mobile user views the page, **When** they scroll through sections, **Then** content remains readable and well-organized without horizontal scrolling
8. **Given** an international visitor views the page, **When** they need English content, **Then** they can click the language toggle to switch from Traditional Chinese to English
9. **Given** a user has selected their preferred language, **When** they navigate within the site, **Then** their language preference persists across page views
10. **Given** a visitor wants to read all module descriptions, **When** they scroll down the page, **Then** all content is immediately visible without requiring additional clicks or expansion actions
11. **Given** a content editor needs to update company capabilities, **When** they modify the structured data files, **Then** changes appear on the site after rebuild/redeploy without code modifications
12. **Given** a visitor on a standard broadband connection, **When** they navigate to the page, **Then** the page loads and becomes interactive within 2 seconds
13. **Given** a visitor wants to contact Moonote, **When** they see the contact email info@moonote.me, **Then** they can click it to open their email client with the address pre-filled
14. **Given** a visitor on mobile wants to call Moonote, **When** they tap the phone number, **Then** their device initiates a call to (+886) 02-23956600

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a visitor switches languages while reading mid-page? (Page content should update immediately, preserving scroll position or section context)
- What happens when company capabilities or modules change? (Content editor updates structured data files, triggers rebuild)
- What happens if the user's browser language is English but page defaults to Chinese? (System should detect browser language and set initial language accordingly)
- How is readability maintained with all 8 modules + 4 solutions expanded on mobile? (Proper spacing, typography, and visual hierarchy must ensure scannability)
- What happens if a translation is missing in the data files? (System should fall back gracefully or show placeholder indicating missing translation)
- What happens on slower mobile connections? (Page should remain usable even if load time exceeds 2-second target, with progressive loading feedback)
