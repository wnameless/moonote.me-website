## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
Visitors to moonote.me need to find official company contact information, including physical address, email, phone number, and legal entity details in both English and Traditional Chinese. This information must be easily accessible for business inquiries, customer support, legal compliance, and verification purposes.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a visitor lands on the company information page, **When** they view the page, **Then** they see the company name in both English ("Moonote Co., Ltd.") and Traditional Chinese ("月本股份有限公司")
2. **Given** a visitor needs to contact the company, **When** they view the contact section, **Then** they see email (info@moonote.me), phone ((+886) 02-23956600), and physical address in both languages
3. **Given** a visitor needs the physical address, **When** they view the location section, **Then** they see "2F, No. 31, Sec. 2, Nanchang Rd., Taipei 100, Taiwan" in English and "100 台北市南昌路二段31號2樓" in Traditional Chinese
4. **Given** a mobile user views the page, **When** they tap the phone number, **Then** their device initiates a phone call
5. **Given** a mobile user views the page, **When** they tap the email address, **Then** their device opens the default email client with info@moonote.me pre-filled

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a user copies the address for navigation apps? (Address should be properly formatted and copyable)
- How does the page handle users with screen readers? (All contact information must be semantically marked up)
- What happens on very small screens? (Information remains readable without horizontal scrolling)
